# Crave Control
Crave control is a responsive web based app that enables control of systems such as clipsal c-bus, fibaro, and advantageair using a single interface.

This repo contains a base install that installs docker and docker-compose, and then installs nginx, php7, and clipsal c-gate and launches them into separate containers. The project is tested to work on the raspberry pi 3+ and Mac OSX.

This project has been created in order to make setting up c-gate on docker, and integrating it with a web interface as simple as possible.
